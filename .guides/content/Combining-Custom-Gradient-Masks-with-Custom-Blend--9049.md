Combining custom gradient masks with custom blend modes opens up even more creative possibilities for your image compositions. You can use these techniques to create smooth transitions between images or to blend images in unique and visually interesting ways.

Here's an example of creating a custom gradient mask and using it with the `custom_blend` function we defined earlier:

```python
# Create a custom gradient mask (grayscale gradient)
width, height = image1.size
mask = Image.new('L', (width, height))
for y in range(height):
    for x in range(width):
        mask.putpixel((x, y), x)

# Apply the custom gradient mask to the second image
masked_image2 = Image.composite(image2, Image.new('RGB', image2.size), mask)

# Blend the images using the custom blend mode
result = custom_blend(image1, masked_image2)

# Save the blended image to a file
result.save('custom_blend_gradient.jpg')

```

In this example, the custom gradient mask is applied to the second image, creating a smooth transition from left (transparent) to right (opaque). The resulting masked image is then blended with the first image using the `custom_blend` function. This creates a smooth transition between the two images with a unique blending effect.

Feel free to experiment with different gradient masks and blend modes to create intricate and visually stunning image compositions using the DALL-E 2 API and PIL. By combining these advanced techniques, you can unlock even more creative possibilities and take your image compositions to the next level.
