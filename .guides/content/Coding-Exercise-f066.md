**Objective**: The goal of this assignment is to make you familiar with the OpenAI's DALL-E API. By the end of this assignment, you will be able to generate and blend images using DALL-E and PIL.


The task is to create a function, `combine`, that performs the following operations:

1. Take two textual prompts as input.
1. Use these prompts to generate images using the DALL-E API.
1. Download these generated images. Name the images: `image1.png` and `image2.png`
1. Blend these images using a blending function.
1. Save the final blended image to a file named `final_blended.png`.
